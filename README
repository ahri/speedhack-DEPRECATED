Aim
---
To speed up usage of a Linux system at the cost of a "pre-loading" period at
boot time. This will be achieved by selecting  directories whose contents are
read more often than they are written and loading them into memory.

Reason
------
To make the desktop experience of an end-user a "lighter" affair.

Result
------
Tested with Crunchbang Linux (Lite) plain install, and Firefox 3.5 with
extensions detailed below, on a PATA laptop in battery mode with 4GB RAM.

Without speedhackd:                                                     7s
With speedhackd running on /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /home/$USER/.mozilla:    2s

Net speed gain with speedhackd:                                       350%

Note that timings are approximate and were begun from execution time until the
GUI window appeared on screen. Even with allowance for timing errors the
solution makes a clear impact upon the experience of a user.

Firefox Extensions used:
        Adlock Plus
        Flashblock
        FireGestures
        Vimperator
        Firebug
        Download Statusbar
        Nuke Anything Enhanced

Summary
-------
Daemon to mount specified system directories into tmpfs and to mirror back the
changes as they occur  -- hopefully providing a speed benefit to a Linux
system.

Dependencies
------------
tmpfs
rsync
inotifywait

Detail
------
speedhackd mounts specified directories into tmps, mirrors the system contents
into them with rsync, and supplants the directories with the tmpfs mounts.

It (optionally) mirrors back any changes in the tmpfs mounts with a custom
monitoring script built over inotifywait, hopefully maintaining an accurate
copy of the directories on the hard drive as they are made.

Warranty
--------
It is strongly suggested that it is used in a read-only fashion.
Mirroring back behaviour is not safe and not working at this time.
