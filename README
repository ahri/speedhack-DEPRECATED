Aim
---
To speed up usage of a Linux system at the cost of a "pre-loading" period at
boot time. This will be achieved by selecting directories whose contents are
read more often than they are written and loading them into memory.

Reason
------
To make the desktop experience of an end-user a "lighter" affair.

Result
------
Tested with Crunchbang Linux (Lite) plain install, and Firefox 3.5 with
extensions detailed below, on a PATA laptop in battery mode with 4GB RAM.

Without speedhack:                                                     7s
With speedhack running on /usr/bin, /usr/lib, /home/$USER/.mozilla:    2s

Net speed gain with speedhack:                                       350%

Note that timings are approximate and were begun from execution time until the
GUI window appeared on screen. Even with allowance for timing errors the
solution makes a clear impact upon the experience of a user.

Firefox Extensions used:
        Adlock Plus
        Flashblock
        FireGestures
        Vimperator
        Firebug
        Download Statusbar
        Nuke Anything Enhanced

Summary
-------
Script to mount specified system directories into tmpfs -- hopefully providing
a speed benefit to a Linux system.

Dependencies
------------
tmpfs
rsync

Detail
------
speedhack mounts specified directories into tmps, mirrors the system contents
into them with rsync, and supplants the directories with the tmpfs mounts.

Warranty
--------
None at all. By the very nature of this script an extra layer is introduced
between you and your important system files. If you fail to copy back files
then you WILL lose data when power is lost.
